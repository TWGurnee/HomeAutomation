NOTES:

Exercise Weekly Plan:

Want to generate a weekly exercise plan that includes Cardio and Weight Training.

5-6 days of exercise a week. 1 - 2 rest days.
5k on its own can be a quasi-rest day.

Need to write algorith to generate weekly exercise plan based on previous data.
Should have a database for each weeks inputs and plans. (At least 1 - 2 seeded)

Cardio:
Schedule requirements:
3x a week
Mix of 5k and 10 k runs (perhaps FARTLEK and HIIT)
5K can be on gym days.
Logging the total time and pace?

Weights:
Split by muscle group. 

Schedule requirements:
Shouldn't overload certain muscle groups: Legs then back // Shoulders then Chest. Perhaps keep these together?
3-4 days a week.

Build requirements:
Need list of muscle groups (and relevant exercise and warm ups)
Classes for exercises (& perhaps muscle groups)
Classes would contain self.reps and self.kg


DB: Storage of weekly plans and relevant reps/weights.
GUI: Input for logging. (Watch app?!?)
